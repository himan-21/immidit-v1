    "text": "Priya, a 26-year-old software engineer in Gurgaon, wakes up with a high fever and body ache. She lives alone, and she's too weak to drive to a hospital. She needs someone to check her temperature, assess if it's dengue or just viral, maybe draw a blood sample. But who?\n\nHospitals mean a 30-minute drive, crowded ERs, and 2-hour waits. Home nursing services? They need 24-hour advance booking and cost ₹2,000+ for a single visit. Untrained help from nearby? Risky. She's stuck - sick, alone, and helpless."
