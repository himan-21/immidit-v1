    "text": "Priya, a 26-year-old software engineer in Gurgaon, wakes up at 3 AM with severe stomach pain and high fever. She lives alone, her family is in another city, and she's too weak to drive. She needs someone to check her vitals, assess her condition, maybe administer an injection or draw blood for tests. But who can she call at this hour?\n\nHospitals mean navigating through traffic, crowded emergency rooms, and long waiting times - all while she can barely stand. Home nursing services require advance booking and aren't available for immediate needs. Calling an untrained helper? Too risky for her health. She's stuck - unwell, alone, and without immediate help when she needs it most."

    "text": "In urban India, medical emergencies don't always need a hospital - but finding immediate, verified professional care at home is nearly impossible.\n\nWe bridge this gap by connecting you with verified, nearby medical professionals (nurses, paramedics, lab assistants) who can reach your home in minutes - without the hospital chaos or premium pricing."
